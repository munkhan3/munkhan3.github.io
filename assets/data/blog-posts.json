By pairing drive level win probability deltas with timeout inventory, we identify when an offense should lean into the sideline, press tempo, or force the defense to burn clock.</p><ul><li>We bucket possessions by clock, score state, and remaining timeouts for both teams.</li><li>Each play is graded against historical leverage to highlight when play callers leave free win probability on the field.</li><li>Staffs receive a weekly scout packet summarizing opponent tendencies in the final two minutes of each half.</li></ul><h2 id=\"model-architecture\">Model Architecture</h2><p>The engine blends logistic regression with gradient boosted calibration layers to keep predictions stable in outlier situations.
