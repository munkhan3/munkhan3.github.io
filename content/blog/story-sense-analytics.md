## Training Analysts as Storytellers
We built a six-week micro curriculum covering narrative arcs, pacing, and delivery. Analysts pair up to critique each other's dry runs so everyone gets reps delivering insights out loud.

## Story Sprints
Each sprint ends with a story room: analysts pitch a three minute story to cross-functional peers. Feedback focuses on clarity and resonance, not SQL.

### Feedback rubric
We grade on hook strength, data-to-story linkage, and the explicit call to action.

## Distribution Channels
Stories travel farther when they live where teams already hang out. We cut 60-second highlight reels for Slack, publish long-form breakdowns in Notion, and host lunch-and-learns for deeper dives.

## Coaching Notes
Encourage analysts to keep a swipe file of great stories. Then practice, practice, practiceâ€”the reps build confidence faster than any template.
