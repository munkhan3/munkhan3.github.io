## Framing the Narrative
Every diagnostic starts with a narrative spine: protagonist (customer), conflict (friction), resolution (product bet). We map data points to each beat so charts back the story instead of overwhelming it.

- Define the protagonist by persona, moment, and motivation.
- Highlight the conflict with quantified friction paired with verbatim quotes.
- Position the resolution as a testable hypothesis with leading indicators.

## Workshop Agenda
The storyboard session runs 90 minutes and mixes async prep with live synthesis.

1. **Pre-read deck:** 10 slides, consumed async, includes narrative spine and data appendix.
2. **Workshop:** 45 minutes of co-creation using Miro frames that force prioritization.
3. **Commitment:** 30 minutes to assign owners, define counter-metrics, and schedule validation.

## Artifacts That Travel
We package outputs into a one-page pilot brief, a six-slide stakeholder share-out, and a loom walkthrough. That triple threat covers tactical planning, executive alignment, and async onboarding for new collaborators.

## Starter Kit
Grab the storyboard template, pre-fill it with a real friction point, and test it with your next cross-functional swarm. Iteration beats over-planning.
