## Cadence Architecture
We anchor the week with three touchpoints: a Monday intent sync, midweek async loom check-ins, and a Friday retro jam. Each ritual has a template that keeps conversation focused on signal, not status.

### What we cover on Mondays
Teams open with a one slide intent canvas: desired outcomes, potential blockers, and support asks. Every line ties back to an OKR metric so leadership can triage help quickly.

## Feedback Loops That Stick
Hybrid teams crave context. We overlay quantitative dashboards with story snippets from customer calls, then summarize the impact in a two minute async clip. The result: everyone understands why work matters before they dive into execution.

## Toolkit & Templates
Every ritual ships with a duplicatable template. We version them in Notion so squads can tweak frameworks without breaking consistency.

- **Intent Canvas:** Aligns team bets to measurable outcomes.
- **Signal Log:** Captures user anecdotes, experiment reads, and risks.
- **Decision Digest:** Weekly summary with RACI owners and timestamps.

## What To Try Next
Start small: pilot the cadence with one squad for two sprints. Capture feedback, trim steps that feel heavy, and expand once the rhythm feels natural.
