## Translation Layer
Executives do not want coefficientsâ€”they want leverage. We translate model outputs into three ladders: size of prize, confidence, and actions required. Every ladder fits on one slide.

## Packaging Insights
Our insight memo structure keeps attention on what matters.

- **Headline:** One sentence that answers "why now".
- **Evidence:** Three bullet proof points, each backed by a chart and a quote.
- **Decision:** Clear asks with owner, timeline, and investment level.

## Operating Rhythm
We reserve 20 minutes in the weekly exec sync for analytics-led momentum pitches. That slot has a hard rule: show unfinished work, invite feedback, and secure commitment before leaving the room.

## Executive Ready Checklist
- Lead with business outcomes before you mention model accuracy.
- Pre-wire stakeholders with a one-page brief so the live meeting is about decisions.
- Close every presentation with next steps, not next analysis.
