## Guardrails for Velocity
We define a single experiment charter: hypothesis, primary metric, guardrail metric, and stop condition. Anything missing? The experiment waits. This keeps the queue clean and the blast radius small.

## Experiment Lifecycle
Every test moves through four consistent states.

1. **Pitch:** 5-minute async loom sells the upside.
2. **Prep:** Analytics partners wire telemetry and QA guardrails.
3. **Run:** Daily pulse checks to catch anomalies early.
4. **Harvest:** 48-hour turnaround for insight memos and follow-up recommendations.

## Decision Forum
We host a bi-weekly growth council that reviews learnings, greenlights rollouts, and backlogs follow-up ideas. The panel includes product, engineering, design, research, and finance so decisions stick.

Clone the experiment tracker, drop in your next hypothesis, and commit to a single ops rhythm for one quarter. Consistency drives compounding insight.
